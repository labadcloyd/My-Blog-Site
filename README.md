# The Daily Journal

**Version 1.0.0**

---
The daily journal is a simple blog site where you can write your own blogs. This site was made with Node.js along with some npm packages (express, ejs, body-parser, and lodash). This is my first every dynamic site so I apologize if there are some features I couldn't add. But I will be adding more features to the site in the future.

## How to post an article 

In order to compose an article you must head over to the compose page which is actually hidden and can only be accessed by typing in the url with '/compose' as the path. You will be redirected to the compose page and there you can compose an article.
The site currently (v1.0.0) doesn't have a database, meaning once the server restarts, all the data will be erased.
